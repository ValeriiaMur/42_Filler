# 42_Filler

**Create your player program to compete against other students on the famous (or not) Filler board. The principle is simple: two players take on each other on a board, and take turns placing the piece that the master of the game (supplied in the form of a Ruby executable) gives them, earning points. The game stops as soon as a piece can no longer be placed. Little playful project!**

*Two players are figthing each other!*

An arguably smart bot that wins most of the games againts the other players (included in the resources folder). The algorithm is to check every square and if we can put our piece there, check the destination to the enemy. Finally, we are choosing the square closer to the enemy and place our piece there.
